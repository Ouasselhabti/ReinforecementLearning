# UAV Data Collection Algorithms

This repository contains algorithms and simulations related to UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) data collection scenarios. The algorithms and environments provided here are designed for simulating and studying data collection strategies using UAVs.

## Environments

### UAVDataCollectionEnv
- The `UAVDataCollectionEnv` is a custom gym environment that simulates a grid-based data collection scenario for a UAV.
- The grid represents an area to be surveyed, and the UAV must collect data from specific points on the grid.
- The environment provides features like energy management, movement, and data collection.
- It is designed for reinforcement learning experiments related to UAV data collection.

## Algorithms

### DQN (Deep Q-Network)
- The `dqn.py` file contains the implementation of a DQN agent for training UAVs to collect data efficiently.
- The DQN agent uses neural networks to learn optimal policies for data collection.
- It includes memory replay, epsilon-greedy exploration, and other components essential for deep reinforcement learning.

## Example Usage

- You can find example usage of the `UAVDataCollectionEnv` and the DQN agent in the provided Python scripts (`main.py`, `main2.py`, etc.).
- These examples demonstrate how to set up the environment, train the agent, and visualize the data collection process.
